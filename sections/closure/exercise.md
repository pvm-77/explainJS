### 1. Write a function createHelloWorld. It should return a new function that always returns "Hello World".
<details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>
    
```bash
Input: args = []
Output: "Hello World"
Explanation:
const f = createHelloWorld();
f(); // "Hello World"

Input: args = [{},null,42]
Output: "Hello World"
Explanation:
const f = createHelloWorld();
f({}, null, 42); // "Hello World"
```
</details>


Any arguments could be passed to the function but it should still always return "Hello World".


<details>
    <summary>Starter Code</summary>

```js
/**
 * @return {Function}
 */
var createHelloWorld = function() {
    
    return function(...args) {
        
    }
};

/**
 * const f = createHelloWorld();
 * f(); // "Hello World"
 */

```
</details>

### 2.Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).

<details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

    ```bash
Example 1:
Input: n = 10 
["call","call","call"]

Output: [10,11,12]

Explanation: 
counter() = 10 // The first time counter() is called, it returns n.
counter() = 11 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.
counter() = 12 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.

Example 2:
Input: n = -2
["call","call","call","call","call"]

Output: [-2,-1,0,1,2]

Explanation: counter() initially returns -2. Then increases after each sebsequent call.
```
    
</details>
 


<details>
    <summary>Starter Code</summary>

```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {Function} counter
 */
var createCounter = function(n) {
    let increment=0
    return function() {
        return n+
    };
};

/** 
 * const counter = createCounter(10)
 * counter() // 10
 * counter() // 11
 * counter() // 12
 */

```


</details>

### 3.Write a function `expect` that helps developers test their code. It should take in any value `val` and return an object with the following two functions.
- `toBe(val)` accepts another value and returns `true` if the two values `===` each other. If they are not equal, it should throw an error `"Not Equal"`.
  
- `notToBe(val)` accepts another value and returns `true` if the two values `!==` each other. If they are equal, it should throw an error `"Equal"`.

<details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>
    
```bash
Example 1:

Input: func = () => expect(5).toBe(5)

Output: {"value": true}

Explanation: 5 === 5 so this expression returns true.

Example 2:

Input: func = () => expect(5).toBe(null)

Output: {"error": "Not Equal"}

Explanation: 5 !== null so this expression throw the error "Not Equal".

Example 3:

Input: func = () => expect(5).notToBe(null)

Output: {"value": true}

Explanation: 5 !== null so this expression returns true.

```
</details>

```js
        /**
         * @param {string} val
         * @return {Object}
        */
        var expect = function(val) {
    
        };

        /**
     * expect(5).toBe(5); // true
     * expect(5).notToBe(5); // throws "Equal"
        */
```

</details>
 
****************************************************************************************************

### 4.Write a function `createCounter`. It should accept an initial integer `init`. It should return an object with three functions.
The three functions are:

- `increment()` increases the current value by 1 and then returns it.
- `decrement()` reduces the current value by 1 and then returns it.
- `reset()` sets the current value to `init` and then returns it.

<details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

```bash
Example 1:

Input: init = 5, calls = ["increment","reset","decrement"]

Output: [6,5,4]

Explanation:
const counter = createCounter(5);
counter.increment(); // 6
counter.reset(); // 5
counter.decrement(); // 4


Example 2:

Input: init = 0, calls = ["increment","increment","decrement","reset","reset"]

Output: [1,2,1,0,0]

Explanation:
const counter = createCounter(0);
counter.increment(); // 1
counter.increment(); // 2
counter.decrement(); // 1
counter.reset(); // 0
counter.reset(); // 0
```
</details>
 


<details>
    <summary>Starter code</summary>

```js

/**
 * @param {integer} init
 * @return { increment: Function, decrement: Function, reset: Function }
 */
var createCounter = function(init) {

    return {

    }
    
};

/**
 * const counter = createCounter(5)
 * counter.increment(); // 6
 * counter.reset(); // 5
 * counter.decrement(); // 4
 */
```
</details>

### 5. Given a function fn, return a memoized version of that function.

A memoized function is a function that will never be called twice with the same inputs. Instead it will return a cached value.

You can assume there are 3 possible input functions: sum, fib, and factorial.

sum accepts two integers a and b and returns a + b. Assume that if a value has already been cached for the arguments (b, a) where a != b, it cannot be used for the arguments (a, b). For example, if the arguments are (3, 2) and (2, 3), two separate calls should be made.
fib accepts a single integer n and returns 1 if n <= 1 or fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) otherwise.
factorial accepts a single integer n and returns 1 if n <= 1 or factorial(n - 1) * n otherwise.

<details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

```bash
Example 1:

Input:
fnName = "sum"
actions = ["call","call","getCallCount","call","getCallCount"]
values = [[2,2],[2,2],[],[1,2],[]]
Output: [4,4,1,3,2]
Explanation:
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const memoizedSum = memoize(sum);
memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. sum() was called as (2, 2) was not seen before.
memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. However sum() was not called because the same inputs were seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 1
memoizedSum(1, 2); // "call" - returns 3. sum() was called as (1, 2) was not seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
Example 2:

Input:
fnName = "factorial"
actions = ["call","call","call","getCallCount","call","getCallCount"]
values = [[2],[3],[2],[],[3],[]]
Output: [2,6,2,2,6,2]
Explanation:
const factorial = (n) => (n <= 1) ? 1 : (n * factorial(n - 1));
const memoFactorial = memoize(factorial);
memoFactorial(2); // "call" - returns 2.
memoFactorial(3); // "call" - returns 6.
memoFactorial(2); // "call" - returns 2. However factorial was not called because 2 was seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
memoFactorial(3); // "call" - returns 6. However factorial was not called because 3 was seen before.
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
Example 3:

Input:
fnName = "fib"
actions = ["call","getCallCount"]
values = [[5],[]]
Output: [8,1]
Explanation:
fib(5) = 8 // "call"
// "getCallCount" - total call count: 1
```
    
</details>


<details>
    <summary>Starter Code</summary>

```js
/**
 * @param {Function} fn
 * @return {Function}
 */
function memoize(fn) {
    
    return function(...args) {
        
    }
}


/** 
 * let callCount = 0;
 * const memoizedFn = memoize(function (a, b) {
 *	 callCount += 1;
 *   return a + b;
 * })
 * memoizedFn(2, 3) // 5
 * memoizedFn(2, 3) // 5
 * console.log(callCount) // 1 
 */
```
</details>

### 6.Given an array of functions [f1, f2, f3, ..., fn], return a new function fn that is the function composition of the array of functions.

The function composition of [f(x), g(x), h(x)] is fn(x) = f(g(h(x))).

The function composition of an empty list of functions is the identity function f(x) = x.

You may assume each function in the array accepts one integer as input and returns one integer as output.

<details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

```bash
Example 1:

Input: functions = [x => x + 1, x => x * x, x => 2 * x], x = 4
Output: 65
Explanation:
Evaluating from right to left ...
Starting with x = 4.
2 * (4) = 8
(8) * (8) = 64
(64) + 1 = 65
Example 2:

Input: functions = [x => 10 * x, x => 10 * x, x => 10 * x], x = 1
Output: 1000
Explanation:
Evaluating from right to left ...
10 * (1) = 10
10 * (10) = 100
10 * (100) = 1000
Example 3:

Input: functions = [], x = 42
Output: 42
Explanation:
The composition of zero functions is the identity function

```

/**
* @param {Function[]} functions
* @return {Function}

var compose = function(functions) {
    
    return function(x) {
        
    }
};

/**
* const fn = compose([x => x + 1, x => 2 * x])
* fn(4) // 9

# MCQs

### 1. What will be the output of the following code?
<details>
    <summary>code</summary>

```js

(function() {
    var a = b = 5;
})();
console.log(b);

```
</details>

<details>
    <summary>options</summary>

    A. 5
B. undefined
C. ReferenceError: b is not defined
D. TypeError: b is not a function

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>

    **Reason**: The expression var a = b = 5; assigns 5 to b without using var, making b a global variable. Hence, console.log(b); outputs 5.

</details>

*********************************************************************************************
### 2. What will be the output of the following code?

<details>
    <summary>code</summary>

       
```js

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>options</summary>


A. 0 1 2
B. 3 3 3
C. 0 0 0
D. undefined undefined undefined


</details>
<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>

    The correct answer is B. 3 3 3.

This is because the `setTimeout` function is asynchronous, so when it is called, it does not execute immediately. Instead, it schedules the function to be executed after a specified delay. In this case, the function is scheduled to be executed three times, but the value of `i` is not captured at the time the function is scheduled. Instead, the value of `i` is captured at the time the function is executed, which is after the loop has finished and `i` has been incremented to 3. Therefore, the output is `3 3 3`.

### 3. How can you fix the loop issue in question 2 to print 0 1 2?
<details>
    <summary>code</summary>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>options</summary>
    A. Use let instead of var.
    B. Use an IIFE to capture the value of i.
    C. Use setInterval instead of setTimeout.
    D. Both A and B.

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>

    To fix the loop issue and print 0 1 2, you can either use let instead of var or use an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to capture the value of i.
Using let
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}
```
Using let creates a new block-scoped variable for each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the correct value of i is captured for each setTimeout function.
Using an IIFE:
```js
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  (function(i) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
  })(i);
}
```
The IIFE captures the value of i for each iteration of the loop and passes it to the inner function, ensuring that the correct value is used when the setTimeout function is executed.
Both solutions will output 0 1 2 to the console.

*********************************************************************************************
### 4. What will be the output of the following code?
<details>

    ```js

var x = 10;
(function() {
    console.log(x);
    var x = 20;
    console.log(x);
})();
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>options</summary>
    A. 10 20
B. undefined 20
C. undefined undefined
D. ReferenceError: x is not defined

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>

    because the variable x is declared with var in the outer scope, and the IIFE does not capture the value of x from the outer scope. Instead, the IIFE creates a new scope, and the var x = 20 declaration inside the IIFE shadows the outer scope's x variable. Therefore, the first console.log(x) statement logs undefined, and the second console.log(x) statement logs 20

    The key concepts used to solve this problem are:
    Variable Scope: Understanding the difference between global, function, and block scope is crucial in determining the behavior of variables declared with var and let.
    Variable Hoisting: var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with undefined, while let declarations are not fully hoisted and cannot be accessed before their declaration.
    Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE): An IIFE creates a new scope, which can affect the behavior of variables declared inside it.
    Shadowing: When a variable with the same name is declared in a nested scope, it shadows the variable in the outer scope.

### 5. Consider the following module pattern. Which of the following statements is true?
<details>
    <summary>code</summary>

```js

var Module = (function() {
    var privateVar = "I am private";
    function privateMethod() {
        return privateVar;
    }
    return {
        publicMethod: function() {
            return privateMethod();
        }
    };
})();

console.log(Module.publicMethod());
console.log(Module.privateVar);
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>options</summary>


A. I am private and I am private
B. I am private and undefined
C. undefined and undefined
D. ReferenceError: privateMethod is not defined

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>

    The code defines a module with a private variable privateVar and a private method privateMethod. The public method publicMethod returns the result of calling privateMethod. When publicMethod is called, it correctly returns the value of privateVar.
However, when trying to access privateVar directly, it is undefined because it is not accessible from outside the module. The privateVar is only accessible within the module, and the publicMethod is the only way to access its value.
The key concepts used to solve this problem are:
Encapsulation: The module encapsulates its private variables and methods, making them inaccessible from outside the module.
Access Control: The module controls access to its private variables and methods through the public method publicMethod.
Module Pattern: The code uses the module pattern to create a self-contained module with private and public parts.

#Encapsulation
#AccessControl
#ModulePattern

###  6. What will be the output of the following code?
<details>
    <summary>code</summary>

    ```js

function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return {
        increment: function() {
            count += 1;
            return count;
        },
        decrement: function() {
            count -= 1;
            return count;
        }
    };
}

const counter1 = createCounter();
const counter2 = createCounter();

console.log(counter1.increment());
console.log(counter1.increment());
console.log(counter2.increment());
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>options</summary>

    A. 1 2 3
B. 1 2 1
C. 2 3 1
D. 1 1 1

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>



The createCounter function returns an object with increment and decrement methods. Each time increment is called, it increments the count variable and returns the new value. Each time decrement is called, it decrements the count variable and returns the new value.
The counter1 and counter2 variables are separate instances of the createCounter function, each with its own count variable. Therefore, when counter1 is incremented twice, it increments its own count variable, and when counter2 is incremented once, it increments its own count variable.
The output is:
counter1.increment() increments counter1's count to 1.
counter1.increment() increments counter1's count to 2.
counter2.increment() increments counter2's count to 1.
The key concepts used to solve this problem are:
Closure: The createCounter function returns an object with methods that capture the count variable from the outer scope, creating a closure.
Separate Instances: Each call to createCounter creates a new instance of the counter, with its own count variable.

#Closure
#SeparateInstances

###   7. What will be the output of the following code?
<details>
    <summary>code</summary>

    ```js

let f;
{
    let o = { note: "Safe" };
    f = function() { return o; };
}
let o = { note: "Not safe" };
console.log(f().note);
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>options</summary>

    A. Safe
B. Not safe
C. undefined
D. ReferenceError: o is not defined

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>


The correct answer is "Safe".
The code defines a function f that returns the object o created in the block scope. The object o is defined before the function f is assigned, so f captures the reference to o at the time it is defined.
Later, when o is reassigned to a new object, it does not affect the object returned by f, because f still holds a reference to the original object.
Therefore, when f is called and its return value is logged, it still returns the original object with the note "Safe".
The reason for this behavior is that the function f captures the reference to the object o at the time it is defined, creating a closure. This means that f retains a reference to the original object o, even after o is reassigned.
Thesure.
Scope: The object o is defined in a block scope, which is separate from the scope where f is defined.
The tags for these concepts are:
#Closure
#Scope key concepts used to solve this problem are:
Closure: The function f captures the reference to the object o at the time it is defined, creating a closure.
Scope: The object o is defined in a block scope, which is separate from the scope where f is defined.

###  8. Which statement about closures is true?

<details>
    <summary>code</summary>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>options</summary>

    A. Closures only have access to their own local variables.
B. Closures have access to variables from their own scope and the global scope only.
C. Closures have access to their own scope, the scope of the outer function(s), and the global scope.
D. Closures cannot access variables from their outer function's scope.


</details>
<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>


The correct answer is C. Closures have access to their own scope, the scope of the outer function(s), and the global scope.
A closure is a function that has access to its own scope and the scope of the outer functions in which it was defined. This means that a closure can access variables from its own scope, as well as from the scope of the outer functions, and even from the global scope.

function outer() {
    let x = 10;

    function inner() {
        console.log(x);
    }

    return inner;
}

const innerFunc = outer();
innerFunc(); // Output: 10

In this example, the inner function has access to the variable x from the outer function's scope, even after the outer function has returned. This is because inner is a closure that captures the scope of outer at the time it was defined.
The key concepts used to solve this problem are:
Closure: A closure is a function that has access to its own scope and the scope of the outer functions in which it was defined.
Scope: A scope is the region of the code where a variable is defined and accessible.
Lexical Environment: A lexical environment is the environment in which a function is defined, which includes the variables and functions that are accessible to that function.

#Closure
#Scope
#LexicalEnvironment

### 9. What will be the output of the following code?

<details>
    <summary>code</summary>

    ```js

var foo = 1;
(function() {
    console.log(foo);
    var foo = 2;
    console.log(foo);
})();
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>options</summary>


A. 1 2
B. undefined 2
C. undefined undefined
D. ReferenceError: foo is not defined

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>


The correct answer is B. undefined 2.
The reason for this output is due to variable hoisting and scope in JavaScript.
When the code is executed, the JavaScript engine first hoists the var declarations to the top of their respective scopes. In this case, the var foo declaration inside the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is hoisted to the top of the function scope. However, the assignment foo = 2 is not hoisted.
So, the code is interpreted as:
var foo = 1;
(function() {
    var foo;
    console.log(foo); // Output: undefined
    foo = 2;
    console.log(foo); // Output: 2
})();

ined.
The tags for these concepts are:
#VariableHoisting
#Scope

The first console.log(foo) statement inside the IIFE accesses the foo variable in its own scope, which is undefined due to hoisting. The second console.log(foo) statement correctly outputs 2 because the assignment foo = 2 has been executed by that point.
The key concepts used to solve this problem are:
Variable Hoisting: var declarations are hoisted to the top of their respective scopes, but initializations are not.
Scope: The IIFE creates a new scope, which is separate from the global scope where var foo = 1 is defined.

###  10. What is the value of x after the following code executes?

<details>
    <summary>code</summary>

    ```js

var x = 5;
(function() {
    var x = 10;
})();
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>options</summary>


A. 5
B. 10
C. undefined
D. ReferenceError: x is not defined

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>

        The correct answer is A. 5.
The code defines a variable x with the value 5 in the global scope. Then, it defines an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that declares a new variable x with the value 10 within its scope.
The key concept here is variable hoisting. The var x = 10 declaration inside the IIFE is hoisted to the top of the function scope, but the assignment x = 10 is not. Therefore, the x variable inside the IIFE is initially undefined.
When the IIFE is executed, it does not affect the global x variable, which remains 5.

    A. 5
    B. 10
    C. undefined
    D. ReferenceError: x is not defined

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Reason</summary>
    Reason: Inside the function foo, x is re-declared as a local variable due to the function x() {} declaration. This local x shadows the global x. The assignment x = 10 affects the local x, not the global x. Therefore, console.log(x); logs the original global value, 5.
