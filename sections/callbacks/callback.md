// Define a function that takes two arguments and a callback
function add(a, b, callback) {
  const result = a + b;
  // Invoke the callback function and pass the result as an argument
  callback(result);
}

// Define a callback function that logs the result to the console
function logResult(result) {

// Call the add function and pass in the two arguments and the callback function
add(2, 3, logResult);

// Output: The result is 5

1. We define a function called add that takes two arguments a and b, and a callback function callback.

2. Inside the add function, we perform an operation on a and b and store the result in a variable called result.
   
3. We then invoke the callback function and pass in the result as an argument.
   
4. Next, we define a callback function called logResult that takes in a result parameter and logs it to the console.
   
5. Finally, we call the add function and pass in the values 2, 3, and logResult as the callback function.
When the add function is called, it performs the operation 2 + 3 and stores the result in the result variable. It then invokes the callback function and passes in the result variable as an argument.

The logResult function is the callback function that is passed into the add function. When add invokes the callback function, it passes in the result variable. The logResult function receives the result variable as a parameter, and logs it to the console.

Therefore, the output of this code will be The result is 5.


# take an example to see how callbacks behave in the JavaScript engine.
```js
function downloadFile(url, callback) {
  console.log(`Downloading ${url}...`);
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(`Downloaded ${url}`);
    callback();
  }, 3000);
}

function processFile() {
  console.log("Processing downloaded file...");
}

downloadFile("https://example.com/file.pdf", processFile);
console.log("Program execution completed.");
```
Here, we have defined two functions: downloadFile and processFile. The downloadFile function takes two arguments: url and callback. The url argument specifies the URL of the file to download, and the callback argument is a function to be executed after the file has been downloaded.

The processFile function simply logs a message to the console to indicate that the downloaded file is being processed.

In the main program, we call the downloadFile function with two arguments: the URL of the file to download and the processFile function as the callback.

When this code is executed, the output to the console will be:
Downloading https://example.com/file.pdf...
Program execution completed.
Downloaded https://example.com/file.pdf
Processing downloaded file...



Let's see how this code is executed in the JavaScript engine:

The downloadFile and processFile functions are declared and stored in memory during the creation phase.
The downloadFile function is called with two arguments: "https://example.com/file.pdf" and the processFile function. The function call is added to the call stack.
The console.log statement inside downloadFile is executed, which logs the message "Downloading https://example.com/file.pdf..." to the console.
The setTimeout function is called, which sets a timer for 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds). The anonymous function passed to setTimeout is added to the event queue to be executed after the timer expires.
The console.log statement after downloadFile is executed, which logs the message "Program execution completed." to the console.
The call stack is now empty, and the JavaScript engine checks the event queue for any tasks to execute. It finds the anonymous function added by setTimeout and adds it to the call stack.
The anonymous function is executed, which logs the message "Downloaded https://example.com/file.pdf" to the console and calls the callback function (which is processFile in this case).
The processFile function is added to the call stack and executed, which logs the message "Processing downloaded file..." to the console.
The call stack is now empty, and the program execution is completed.
In this example, the processFile function is passed as a callback to the downloadFile function. The downloadFile function sets a timer for 3 seconds, during which the program continues to execute. After 3 seconds, the anonymous function passed to setTimeout is executed, which logs a message to the console and calls the callback function (processFile). The processFile function is then executed, which logs another message to the console.

This demonstrates how callbacks allow us to execute code asynchronously in response to some event, in this case, the completion of a file download. The JavaScript engine uses the event queue and call stack to ensure that the callback function is executed only after the initial function has completed its execution.



# Another example


```js
const button = document.querySelector('button');

function handleClick() {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
}

button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
console.log('Program execution completed.');
```

let's take another example to see how callbacks behave in response to a different type of event.

Consider the following code:

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button');
function handleClick() {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
}
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
console.log('Program execution completed.');
```
Here, we have defined a button element in the HTML markup and selected it using the querySelector method. We have also defined a function handleClick that logs a message to the console when the button is clicked.

In the main program, we add an event listener to the button element using the addEventListener method. The click event is specified as the first argument, and the handleClick function is specified as the callback function to be executed when the button is clicked.

When this code is executed, the output to the console will be:

<samp>Program execution completed.</samp>
</br>
</br>

This is because the program execution completes before the button is clicked and the handleClick function is executed.

Let's see how this code is executed in the JavaScript engine:

1. The `button` variable is declared and assigned the value of the button element selected using `querySelector`.

2. The `handleClick` function is declared and stored in memory during the creation phase.

3. The `addEventListener` method is called on the `button` element, which adds the `click` event and the `handleClick` function as the callback to be executed when the button is clicked.

4. The `console.log` statement after `addEventListener` is executed, which logs the message `"Program execution completed."` to the console.
   
5. The call stack is now empty, and the JavaScript engine waits for any events to occur.

6. When the button is clicked, the  `handleClick` function is added to the event queue to be executed as soon as the call stack is empty.

7. The  `handleClick` function is added to the call stack and executed, which logs the message "Button clicked!" to the console.


In this example, the `handleClick` function is passed as a callback to the `addEventListener` method to be executed when the `click` event occurs. The JavaScript engine waits for any events to occur while the call stack is empty. When the button is clicked, the `handleClick` function is added to the event queue to be executed as soon as the call stack is empty.

This demonstrates how callbacks allow us to execute code in response to events that occur in the browser, such as user interactions. The JavaScript engine uses the event queue and call stack to ensure that the callback function is executed only when the specified event occurs.
