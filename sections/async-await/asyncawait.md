When the await keyword is used inside an async function, it will pause the execution of the function until the promise is resolved. While the function is waiting for the promise to resolve, the JavaScript engine can execute other code that's not blocked by the await keyword.

So, to answer your question, the code after the await keyword will not execute until the promise is resolved. However, other code outside of the async function can execute while the function is waiting for the promise to resolve.

Here's an example to illustrate this:
```js
async function getData() {
  console.log('Fetching data...');

  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();

  console.log('Data retrieved:', data);
}

console.log('Before calling getData');
getData();
console.log('After calling getData');

```
In this example, the getData function contains an asynchronous operation that fetches data from an API. The console.log statements before and after calling the getData function are outside of the function.

When the code is executed, the output will be:

Before calling getData
Fetching data...
After calling getData
Data retrieved: [data returned from API]


As you can see, the code outside of the getData function continues to execute while the function is waiting for the promise to resolve. However, the code after the await keywords inside the getData function will not execute until the promise is resolved.
